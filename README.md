How to use the scripts
Create list of matrices of different biological views to run MOFA, and fit MOFA model
Downstream analysis of MOFA to investigate heterogeneity within data
Script to analyse relation between mutation (SF3B1 and SRSF2) and gene set signatures and their clinical outcome
Boxplots of gene signatures that significantly associated with mutations

Example figure generation
