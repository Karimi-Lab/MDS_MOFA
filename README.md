## Summary of the paper

## How to use the scripts
Create list of matrices of different biological views to run MOFA, and fit MOFA model
Downstream analysis of MOFA to investigate heterogeneity and relationships of different modalities with latent factors
Script to analyse association between mutation (SF3B1 and SRSF2) and gene set signatures and their clinical outcome
Boxplots of gene signatures that significantly associated with mutations based on mutation status

## Example figure generation 

### Generate heatmap of important features with high weights for each views per factor
